# pomodora_gui
  Code Explanation
     Overview

This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method where work is divided into intervals (usually 25 minutes), separated by short breaks. After four work intervals, a longer break is taken. This app implements that technique with adjustable work and break times.

   Features

-   Timer Display:   Shows the countdown for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
-   Pomodoro Cycle:   Alternates between work sessions and breaks based on a typical Pomodoro cycle.
-   Check Marks:   Displays check marks to track completed work sessions.
-   Start/Reset Button:   Allows the user to start the timer and reset it whenever needed.
  
   How to Use

1.   Start the Timer:  
   - Click the   Start   button to begin a Pomodoro cycle.
   - The timer will count down for a work session, followed by a short break, and after every 4 work sessions, it will take a long break.

2.   Reset the Timer:  
   - Click the   Reset   button at any time to cancel the current timer and reset the countdown to  00:00 .
   - The check marks will also be reset.

3.   Work Sessions & Breaks:  
   - Work sessions are 30 minutes by default.
   - Short breaks are 5 minutes, and long breaks are 20 minutes.
   
   The cycle follows this pattern:
   -   Work (30 minutes)   →   Short Break (5 minutes)   →   Work (30 minutes)   →   Short Break (5 minutes)   →   Work (30 minutes)   →   Short Break (5 minutes)   →   Work (30 minutes)   →   Long Break (20 minutes)   → (Repeat)

4.   Tracking Progress:  
   - The app displays check marks to show the number of completed work sessions (each pair of work sessions is followed by a break).


-   Timer Mechanism:   
   The  start_timer()  function starts the timer, switching between work and break sessions. It also increments the  reps  counter, which tracks the number of completed sessions.
   
-   Countdown Mechanism:   
   The  count_down()  function runs the timer by decreasing the time by 1 second every time and updates the display. When the timer reaches zero, it starts the next session (either work or break).
   
-   UI Setup:   
   - The window is created using Tkinter, and the UI consists of a title, a canvas with a tomato image, the timer display, and buttons for starting and resetting the timer.
   
-   Reset Timer:  
   The  reset_timer()  function stops the timer and resets all UI elements, including the check marks.

   Customization

You can easily adjust the times for work sessions and breaks by modifying the following constants in the code:

   python
WORK_MIN = 0.30           Work time in minutes (30 minutes)
SHORT_BREAK_MIN = 5        Short break time in minutes (5 minutes)
LONG_BREAK_MIN = 20        Long break time in minutes (20 minutes)
   

Feel free to change these values to suit your needs.
